hello

this is the 1st version of the NEM BE.
the feauters that are implemente are

design:
	for desktop computers normal screen sizes
	with 2 look & feel colors
	
	note on color (L&F):
	you can change the color by change the body class from green to blue
	or the opposite
	
	this could also be implemented as a feature for the users
	to change the L&F by themselves and use what is best for them.
	
	
blocks:
	navigation by click on link in the bottom
	navigation by arrows left right keybord short cuts

	dyinamic blocks updates trough socket connection on the 1st page

note on navigation:
	navigation works by keeping 
	internal page counter which means that 
	refreshing the page will reload the page with display of last 
	25 blocks
	
	as well curretnly is not possible to use browser's 
	back and forward buttons to switch between pages.
	
	if there is need this can be changed by using 
	on page links to store history and therefore the browser's prevoise and next button should work.

	styling:
		change the serch box to be like in the given design exmples
		add responsive behaviour to the page
